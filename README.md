# POCKET-GARDEN
Pocket Garden turns your to-do list into a living, breathing world of tiny plants. With every task you finish, your garden gently grows as a new little plant joins the soil. By the end of the day, your completed tasks form a warm, colorful space that shows how small steps create beautiful growth.
